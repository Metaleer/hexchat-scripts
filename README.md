# hexchat-scripts
A bunch of HexChat scripts that probably no-one will use. :P
##akill.py
A simple script to make AKILLing easier without having to use the full services syntax.

Syntax: /sakill  <nick|hostmask> <public reason> | <private oper reason>

By default, it issues a 24 hour AKILL, which you can of course change.
